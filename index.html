                            I am currently spearheading the transformation of our interactive voice response system (IVR) by crafting use cases that boost self-service capabilities and ensure legal compliance. Leading the migration to a natural language understanding IVR, I am expanding self-service options and enriching the customer experience. By analyzing service trends and partnering with the customer protection team, I am optimizing agent efficiency and refining servicing strategies. To minimize fraud losses, I am devising implementation strategies that pinpoint vulnerable consumer activities through real-time risk assessment. I am proactively mitigating compliance risks by crafting policies, procedures, and implementing relevant controls. Additionally, I am designing daily alerts and monitoring controls to effectively manage operational risks and address concerns promptly. In collaborating with business strategy, I am creating analytical dashboards that track call volume, customer journey, and IVR metrics.

My focus was on leveraging big data for actionable insights. I automated the data collection process for Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines, applying feature engineering to craft impactful operational dashboards showcasing POS data using Superset. To ensure continuous data and application monitoring, I deployed a dedicated GCP instance and implemented scheduled tasks using Python. My passion for natural language processing (NLP) led me to develop a model using TF-IDF vectorizer and a Random Forest classifier. This model effectively distinguished between "food" and "drink" labels, achieving an impressive 93.1% accuracy. This project provided me with valuable experience in collaborating effectively, harnessing the power of big data, and developing innovative NLP solutions.

This project harnessed the power of supercomputers, where I deployed an LSTM neural network on Blue Waters. This network addressed the challenge of missing data points by imputing them with an 83.7% accuracy, ensuring a complete picture for analysis. Beyond individual data points, I utilized spectral clustering, a sophisticated mathematical technique, to analyze the overall pattern of glucose fluctuations. This allowed the package to classify individuals with an accuracy of 87.13%, providing valuable insights into their metabolic health status. This personalized approach aimed to empower individuals with a deeper understanding of their glucose patterns, ultimately contributing to better health management and informed decision-making.

                            I led a team of seven consultants, guiding them in providing comprehensive market and strategy consulting to a budding AI-based startup in the healthcare retail industry. Our mission was to pave the way for their successful market entry. To achieve this, we embarked on a thorough competitor analysis, meticulously identifying key drivers, stakeholders, and crucial performance indicators. Armed with these insights, I strategized an optimal market entry plan, focusing on establishing valuable partnerships with retail stores across the USA. This approach promised both efficiency and profitability, giving the startup a solid foundation for growth. Recognizing the importance of clear and timely communication in our globally distributed team, I implemented effective collaboration models leveraging SCRUM practices. This ensured everyone remained aligned and on the same page, ultimately contributing to a successful project outcome.

                                    Sneh and I worked together on the Partner Integrations team at DoorDash. I was so impressed with his technical skills and his ability to tackle hard problems in fast paced environment. From building integrations with key partners to creating new dashboards to expand our team’s data analytics capabilities, Sneh was able to add value to everything he touched. Having Sneh on your team would be an excellent addition!

                                    Sneh started on my team shortly after I myself joined DoorDash. His technical ability, drive to learn new skills and willingness to dive headfirst into challenging problems was immediately evident and highly valuable to our team. He quickly was able to learn the in’s and out’s of the DoorDash infrastructure and served as the technical account manager to a significant number of our high priority merchants. Additionally, Sneh’s technical knowledge was a significant asset to our team. He excels at working with large datasets, using Python and SQL to manipulate data and build effective reports. Any team with Sneh on it is a stronger team.

                                    Sneh was on my team at DoorDash and I cannot say enough about his drive to learn and proficiency with data. He was able to learn a very complex flow in a matter of weeks and use it to build very high impact integrations for our most valuable merchants. He also up-leveled our knowledge of our own data and built highly functional dashboards that have lead to unique insights. Whoever gets to work with Sneh next is very lucky!

                                    Sneh is very proactive with undertaking tasks and helping his team out. He has the ability to pick up new skills - technical or otherwise - and does not shy away from a challenge. It was a pleasure having him on my team!

                                    Sneh and I worked together as colleagues he was the technical lead of a consent management implementation. He was responsible for the direct guidance of the functional and technical requirements of each phase, providing guidance on best practices set up and developing solutions to varied use cases. It has been a wonderful experience collaborating with our teams to deliver on the client's most important requirements, and the success the client attested to in their first 6 months is largely due to Sneh's ability to keep them on task, help them unpack years of unchecked processes, and understand how the work ties to the fulfillment of their long term goals. I will continue to draw from the lessons we learned together.  Although I know Sneh's journey will carry him to new and more exciting adventures, if I could selfishly keep him at OneTrust with me for every assignment forever more I would.
